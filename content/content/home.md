I am a raising sophomore undergraduate student at [Stevens Institute of Technology](https://www.stevens.edu/school-engineering-science/departments/computer-science) pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science. I'm currently working with [Michael Greenberg](https://greenberg.science/) and the rest of the [PaSH Team](https://binpa.sh/) on [a speculative execution engine for the shell](https://sigops.org/s/conferences/hotos/2023/papers/liargkovas.pdf).
